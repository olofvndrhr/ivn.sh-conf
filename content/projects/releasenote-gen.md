## release note generator for github actions

#### https://github.com/olofvndrhr/releasenote-gen

A small bash script which extracts the changes from a CHANGELOG.md file following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

It can be used to generate release-notes for example: new github releases, release api calls, newsletters etc.
