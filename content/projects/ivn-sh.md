## The creation of this site

https://github.com/olofvndrhr/ivn.sh-conf

I was unsure on how to create and deploy my personal site, without to much hassle. I landed on the pretty popular static site framework [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It was relativly simple to setup and get working.

For the deployment aspect, i went with [cloudflare pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) for "hosting" and [web analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics) for the analytics part. I choose this option because i already manage all my domains via cloudflare, and so everything is on one platform for management.
