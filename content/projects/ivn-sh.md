## The creation of this site

#### https://github.com/olofvndrhr/ivn.sh-conf

I was unsure on how to create and deploy my personal site, without too much hassle.
So I landed on the pretty popular static site framework [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
It was relatively simple to set up and get working.

For the deployment, I went with [cloudflare pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)
for "hosting" and [web analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics)
for the analytics part.
I choose this option because I already manage all my domains via cloudflare, and so everything is on one platform for simpler management.
