## Manga download script written in python3

https://github.com/olofvndrhr/manga-dlp

I was in search of a script to download multiple mangas at the same time. The best i found was [mangadex-dl](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/mangadex-dl) which didn't include multiple mangas, or all chapters at the same time. So i took inspiration from mangadex-dl and wrote a script myself. It includes all my needs and is extendable for other sites too.
