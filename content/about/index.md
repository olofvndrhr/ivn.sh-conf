## My name is Ivan Schaller

### And im a DevOps/Network Engineer at Swisscom (Schweiz) AG.

My work is a combination of Operation in Networking and Development in Automation.

---

The main task of our team is the operation and development of multiple L2 and L3 network platforms for business customers across switzerland.

I work mostly with bgp-mpls and bgp-vpls networks, but we are transitioning to more software defined network stacks with cisco nso.

The network equipment im most familiar with is from cisco and juniper. And from configuration to diagnostics I use about every aspect of it.

On the development side, I create internal tools, automate networking tasks and create services for cisco nso.
