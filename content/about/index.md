## My name is Ivan Schaller

### And im a DevOps/Network Engineer at Swisscom (Schweiz) AG.

My work is a combination of Operation in Networking and Development in Automation.

---

My main task is the operation of layer 3 site to site vpn's for different customers. It is a managed service, so reconfiguration,
troubleshooting or other related tasks are my daily business. The services heavily uses BGP to propagate all the networks from the different sites to each other, and vrf's to separate different vpn's on the same device.

I work mostly with Cisco networking equipment, and from configuration to diagnostics I use about every aspect of it.

In the development area, I work with automation of networking tasks, administrative tasks and "small" internal application development.
